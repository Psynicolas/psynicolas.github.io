    <h2>My Framework: Learning Theories</h2>
  </summary>

  I base my learning design and research on established educational psychology and learning theories. This framework ensures that my approaches are evidence-based and effective.

  My core theoretical framework includes:

  * Cognitive Psychology: Understanding how people think, perceive, remember, and learn.
  * Experiential Learning: Emphasizing learning through direct experience and reflection.
  * Social Learning: Focusing on learning from others in a social context.
  * Constructivism: Believing learners construct knowledge actively from their experiences.
  * Multiple Intelligences & SEL: Recognizing diverse forms of intelligence and the importance of socio-emotional learning.
  * Self-Efficacy Theory: Highlighting the belief in one's capacity to succeed in specific situations.
  * Motivation Theory: Exploring what drives learners and sustains their engagement.
  * Autonomy & Relatedness (Self-Determination Theory): Focusing on intrinsic motivation, autonomy, competence, and relatedness.
  * Andragogy: Principles tailored for adult learning and development.
  * Critical Pedagogy: Encouraging learners to challenge and transform oppressive structures.
